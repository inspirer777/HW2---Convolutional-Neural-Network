# HW2-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a homework assignment focused on implementing and analyzing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The notebook includes Python code, data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics for understanding the performance of CNNs.

## File Overview

- **`HW2_CNN_40211403001.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains:
  - Data loading and preprocessing steps.
  - The architecture and implementation of CNN models.
  - Training and evaluation processes, including accuracy and loss metrics.
  - Visualizations of results (e.g., training curves, confusion matrices, etc., if applicable).

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensures the dataset is properly prepared for input into the CNN, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **CNN Model Architecture**: Implements CNN layers such as convolutions, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
3. **Training Loop**: Utilizes optimization techniques and tracks metrics for evaluating model performance.
4. **Visualization**: (If applicable) Visualizes training results and model predictions for better interpretability.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on the framework used in the notebook)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: If the file does not include a `requirements.txt`, you can manually install the above packages.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inspirer777/HW2---Convolutional-Neural-Network.git
  
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HW2_CNN.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell sequentially.

## Results

- The notebook demonstrates the performance of the CNN model, including accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics.
- (Optional) Examples of model predictions or confusion matrices are provided for better visualization of the outcomes.
